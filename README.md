### About Project

React Project 1.2 - Filtering Images based upon Categories

- [Live Demo](https://filterappreact.netlify.app/)

![React Test 1.2 - Image filtering page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zarriy/reactTest/react-1.2/src/assets/appscreen.png)

#### Used Tech Stack:

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Context API

This is a simple filter page where you can view the product images based upon the categories. To made it mobile responsive, I have added the filter component based upon the breakpoints. The context API is used
to aviod props drilling.
Created for Test project 1.2.

Thanks
