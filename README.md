### About Project

React Project 1.1

This project is developed using Vite + React along with TailwindCSS for basic styling of the layout.

This is a simple app that increment and decrement number upon clicking + or -.
To avoid reusability of the classes in both button classes, I have added style to the tailwind component layer in the index.css and reuse it in both buttons.

Thanks
